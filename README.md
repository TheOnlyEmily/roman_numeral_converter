# Golossary 
## Stack
In the context of this documentation, a stack refers to a roman numeral that is any combination of atomic roman numerals. 
## Minimal Stack
A stack of two atomic roman numerals.
## Atomic Roman Numerals
The roman numerals i, v, x, l, c, d, and m, written by themselves. 
## Uniform Stack
A stack that consists of the same atomic roman numeral repeated. 
## Non-uniform Stack
A stack that includes at least two different atomic roman numerals.
## Subtractive Stack
A stack where numeric conversion is accomplished by only subtracting the values of its atomic roman numerals. 
## Additive Stack
A stack where numeric conversion is accomplished by only adding the values of its atomic roman numerals.
